ww-run - run one task card (ww-data\tasks\<id>-*.md) with an LLM engine, safely and visibly.

USAGE
  ww-run.cmd <id> [-Shared | -Main | -Worktree [-Base main]] [-Engine agy|opencode|claude|codex]
             [-Model <name>] [-Extra "<text>"] [-Root <checkout>] [-JsonStdout] [-DryRun]
  ww-run.cmd -Jobs <id>,<id>,... [-Queue <name> [-Concurrency <n>]] [-Out <file>]
             [-Verify "<command>"] [-TimeoutSec <sec>] [-Worktree] [-Engine ...] [-Model ...] [-Root ...]
  ww-run.cmd -Help

MODES (one card per run; the same card never runs twice)
  -Shared    main checkout, in parallel with other runs whose declared paths do not overlap:
             '## Authorised edits' paths are written, '## Read-only' (or '## Reads') paths are
             read. Read/read is fine; an edit of a path another run edits or reads is refused.
             A card without Authorised edits locks the whole checkout. The agent is told to
             edit only its Authorised edits, skip compile/tests and not commit. Edits outside
             the declaration are reported (EditViolations in ww-data\running\<id>.last.json).
             Run the build/tests afterwards, on their own.
             This is the DEFAULT when the card has '## Authorised edits'.
  -Main      main checkout, exclusive (locks the whole checkout); the agent may build/test.
             The default when the card has no Authorised edits.
  -Worktree  own worktree .claude\worktrees\ww-<id> on branch ww/<id>-wt; always parallel;
             merge the branch yourself.

OPTIONS
  -Engine      agy (default, or WW_ENGINE), opencode, claude, codex
  -Model       engine model (or WW_MODEL)
  -Extra       text appended to the prompt
  -Root        checkout root (or WW_ROOT); default: git top level of the current directory
  -JsonStdout  print the raw engine events on stdout (or WW_JSON_STDOUT=1)
  -DryRun      print the plan and the conflict check; change nothing

PCDER JOBS (-Jobs)
  Writes ProcessCommander task-queue jobs for the given cards and runs nothing. Each card
  becomes job ww-<id> running 'ww-run.cmd <id> -Shared ...' with its Authorised edits as
  resources.write and its Read-only paths as resources.read, so pcder only starts cards
  that do not overlap (ww-run checks the same rule again). With -Worktree the jobs use
  -Worktree and declare no resources.
  Cards without Authorised edits and cards that overlap each other are reported on stderr
  (they will run one after another).
  -Queue       also add the jobs to this pcder task queue (pcder.exe from PCDER or PATH);
               the file goes to ww-data\jobs\ unless -Out is given
  -Concurrency queue concurrency for -Queue (default 3)
  -Out         file to write (UTF-8 JSON array); default: print to stdout
  -Verify      add job ww-verify running this command after all cards are done, locking
               the whole checkout (build + tests)
  -TimeoutSec  timeoutSec of every job (default 7200)
  Without -Queue:  pcder.exe taskqueue add --file <file> --taskqueue ww --concurrency 3
  Watch:           pcder.exe taskqueue graph ww   (resource_wait shows who holds what)

SUPERVISOR LLM: run cards in parallel with -Shared
  1. Split the work into cards whose files do not overlap. In each card list every file it
     may edit under '## Authorised edits' and files it only reads under '## Read-only',
     as backticked paths relative to the checkout (`src/a.cpp`, `doc/**`).
  2. ww-run.cmd -Jobs 012,013,014 -Queue ww -Verify "<build and test command>" -Engine claude
  3. pcder.exe taskqueue wait ww   (or taskqueue_wait over MCP); read ww-data\reports\<id>.md
     and check EditViolations in ww-data\running\<id>.last.json.
  4. If ww-verify fails, fix it with one more card (or by hand) and taskqueue retry.
  Do not build or test while card jobs run; ww-verify does that last. Check a card's plan
  with: ww-run.cmd <id> -DryRun

EXIT CODES
  0    the engine finished with 0 (-DryRun: the run would start)
  75   refused: the same card is running, or another run holds overlapping paths. Nothing
       ran; try again later (the reason is in the output and ww-data\logs\refused.log)
  1    setup error: bad options, card not found, worktree pre-flight or creation failed
  else the engine's exit code

  ww-status.cmd shows running and last runs; logs are in ww-data\logs.
